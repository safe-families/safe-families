Systemic Autism-related Family Enabling (SAFE) is a support toolkit for families of children with autism. SAFE was developed in collaboration with families by Professor Rudi Dallos at Plymouth University, UK.

SAFE will now be evaluated in a series of clinical trials lead by the University of Plymouth. More details to follow soon.
